# Simple Web Authn Example with Express and React

This is a barebones example for setting up passkeys using SimpleWebAuthn in a React app. This is based on the [Express-based example in the SimpleWebAuthn project](https://github.com/MasterKale/SimpleWebAuthn/tree/master/example).

To try it out, clone the repo and run the following commands:

```
npm i

cd backend 
npm i

cd ..
npm run dev
```
